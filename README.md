# C Programming — Learning Repository

A personal learning collection of C examples, exercises, and small projects gathered from tutorials and practice.

## Overview
Organized by topic to illustrate core C concepts, practical patterns, and small algorithmic problems. Examples may be experimental or refactored as understanding improves.

## Contents
- Basic syntax and variables  
- Control flow: if/else, loops, switch  
- Functions and scope  
- Arrays, strings, and pointers  
- Structs and memory management  
- Simple algorithms and problem-solving

The goal here is learning and improvement. Some programs may be experimental, incomplete, or refactored over time as I understand concepts more clearly.


## How to compile
Using GCC:
```bash
gcc file.c -o program
./program
```

Using Clang:
```bash
clang file.c -o program
./program
```

## Structure
Files and folders are grouped by topic; names indicate what each example demonstrates to make the learning path easy to follow.

## Notes
This repository evolves with ongoing practice. Feedback and suggestions are welcome; the primary goal is learning and documentation.
